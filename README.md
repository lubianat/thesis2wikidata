# thesis2wikidata

Parsing academic thesis repositories into Wikidata.

The USP folder contains code for reconciling the thesis of the bioinformatics program of the University of SÃ£o Paulo to Wikidata. 

The workflow runs like this: 
* Metadata for the thesis are extracted from a source repository and saved in Python dataclasses. 
* Strings for committee members and thesis authors are uploaded to a Google Spreadsheet, where they are manually reconciled to Wikidata.
* Strings for topics are also added to a Google Spreadsheet and manually reconciled. 
* Via Quickstatements, the theses are created on Wikidata, containting the reconciled people and topics.
